Smart Waste Bin System for Efficient Waste Management: A Network-Based Solution
________________________________________
Problem Definition
Domain: Waste Management, Environmental Technology, IoT
Importance: Inefficient waste collection often leads to overflowing bins, environmental hazards, and resource wastage. This problem affects urban cleanliness and increases operational costs for waste management agencies.
Statistics: Studies indicate that over 30% of waste bins in urban areas overflow due to inefficient collection schedules, resulting in pollution and increased cleanup costs.

Focused Problem
Addressing the issue of detecting bin overflow and enabling quick notifications to authorities for timely waste collection.
________________________________________
Objectives
1.	Reduce waste overflow incidents by providing real-time monitoring.
2.	Automate notifications to waste collection authorities.
3.	Introduce a reward-based app for local residents to report overflowing bins.

Circuit Diagram
This circuit shows connections between the ultrasonic sensor, Wi-Fi module, and power source. The sensor provides data on bin levels, while the Wi-Fi module transmits this information to the cloud for real-time access.

Programming Logic
Core Functions:
1.	Bin Level Detection: Measures bin fill level using the ultrasonic sensor.
2.	Data Transmission: Sends status updates to the cloud when the bin reaches a critical level.
3.	Notification Alert: Sends notifications to authorities and updates the app if the bin is full.
cpp
void setup() {
   // Initialize Wi-Fi, sensor, and cloud connection
}

void loop() {
   int distance = measureBinLevel();
   if (distance < threshold) {
       sendNotification("Bin Full");
   }
   delay(60000);  // Check every 1 minute
}
